# KaggleH1BShiny

This project aims to developing an interactive Shiny dashboard in R. There are three parts in the dashboard:

1. A heatmap displaying median salary and no. of H1B-sponsored positions 
2. A barchart demonstrating Top 10 companies sponsoring H1B visa
3. A histgram showing the no. of H1B applications by year

There are three adjustable select bars on top left where you can specify a particular year range from 2011 to 2016, a pre-defined job position and one of the states in US to interact with the dashboard.
